Hi! I am the first-year [Ph.D. student in Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) 
at the UC San Diego, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). 
My research interests focus on **Controllable Music Generation** in both symbolic and signal domains and **Music Understanding**.

Since March 2023, I have been working as a research assistant under the wonderful guidance of [Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/) 
at National Taiwan University. 
Feel free to listen to the demo from our work on [emotion-driven piano performance generation](https://emo-disentanger.github.io/).

Before joining UCSD, I earned my [M.S. degree in Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) from New York University (NYU) 
and my [B.S. degree in Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn) from Fudan University. 
During my time at Fudan, I worked with [Prof. Deqing Yang](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/c1/56/c22442a508246/page.htm) 
on **concept extraction and generation for knowledge graphs**.
Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at National University of Singapore with [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), 
focusing on **multi-modal question answering**.
