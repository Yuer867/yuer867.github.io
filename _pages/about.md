Hi! I am the second-year [Ph.D. student in Computer Science](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) 
at the UC San Diego, fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). 
My research interests focus on **Controllable Music Generation** in both symbolic and signal domains, **Music Representation Learning** and **Singing Voice Synthesis**.

During the summer of 2025, I had the pleasure of interning at Smule, where I explored [the modeling of singing performance styles](https://stylepitcher.github.io/). 
Earlier, from 2023 to 2024, I worked as a research assistant under the wonderful guidance of [Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/) 
at National Taiwan University, focusing on [emotion-driven music generation](https://emo-disentanger.github.io/).

Before joining UCSD, I earned my [M.S. degree in Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) from New York University (NYU) 
and my [B.S. degree in Data Science](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn) from Fudan University. 
During my time at Fudan, I worked with [Prof. Deqing Yang](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/c1/56/c22442a508246/page.htm) 
on **concept extraction and generation for knowledge graphs**.
Additionally, I worked as a research assistant at National University of Singapore with [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), 
focusing on **multi-modal question answering**.
